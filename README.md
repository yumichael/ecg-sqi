Seeing how one might construct a Signal Quality Index for ECG using data from the CinC 2011 challenge (https://physionet.org/challenge/2011/). A culminating project showing how one of the latest nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, the Diffusion Map or Laplacian Eigenmap, performs on short windows of real life signal data. A presentation can be found **HERE**: (https://yumichael.github.io/jupyter-notebook-slides/#/). The plots are fully interactive!
